The idea behind this very simple package is to help newbies and pros in creating
a starting structure for projects involving python following some of the general
guidelines and principles widely used.

In May 2020, while in the initial steps of learning django, it was amazing to
see how easy it was to create a new project/app and that django had a functionality
that would create an entire folder structure and the baseline files with helpful
tips along the way.

Then started the search to find a similar package that would do just that. Create
a baseline template, some of the files to workout a project structure so I could
dig into the core of the development, without worrying about having the structure
around it.

I found none. That would fit my needs. Simple. Straight Forward. So here we go!
If by any chance there are other more fitted alternatives, I'd love to hear about it.
