## Inspiration and background

In May 2020, while in the initial steps of learning django, it was amazing to
see how easy it was to create a new project/app and that django had a functionality
that would create an entire folder structure and the baseline files with helpful
tips along the way.

Then started the search to find a similar package that would do just that. Create
a baseline template, some of the files to workout a project structure so I could
dig into the core of the development, without worrying about having the structure
around it.

I found none. That would fit my needs. Simple. Straight Forward. So here we go!
If by any chance there are other more fitted alternatives, I'd love to hear about it.
